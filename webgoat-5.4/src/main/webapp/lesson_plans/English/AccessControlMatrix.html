<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Using an Access Control Matrix</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
In a role-based access control scheme, a role represents a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control scheme normally consists of two parts: role permission management and role assignment. A broken role-based access control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or somehow allow privilege escalation to an unauthorized role.  
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
Each user is a member of a role that is allowed to access only certain resources. Your goal is to explore the access control rules that govern this site. Only the [Admin] group should have access to the 'Account Manager' resource.
