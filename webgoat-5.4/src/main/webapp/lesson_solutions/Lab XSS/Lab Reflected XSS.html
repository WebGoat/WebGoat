<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
It is always a good practice to scrub all inputs, especially those inputs that will later be used as parameters to OS commands, scripts, and database queries. It is particularly important for content that will be permanently stored somewhere. Users should not be able to create message content that could cause another user to load an undesirable page or undesirable content when the user's message is retrieved.
XSS can also occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response. In a reflected XSS attack, an attacker can craft a URL with the attack script and post it to another website, email it, or otherwise get a victim to click on it.
</p> 

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
For this exercise, you will perform stored and reflected XSS attacks. You will also implement code changes in the web application to defeat these attacks. 
</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b><br/>
First log in as an user for example as Larry with password larry. Now click on 
the 'SearchStaff' Button. Burry a script in the field for example: 
<code>&lt;script&gt;alert("Dangerous");&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Now hit
the 'FindProfile' Button and you are done.</p>
