<p><b>Lesson Plan Title: </b>Same Origin Policy Protection</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
A key element of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest (XHR), which allows javascript to make asynchronous 
calls from the client side to a server.  However, as a security measure these requests may 
only be made to the server from which the client page originated.
<!-- Stop Instructions -->
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
This exercise demonstrates the Same Origin Policy Protection.  XHR requests 
can only be passed back to the originating server.  Attempts to pass data to 
a non-originating server will fail.";
