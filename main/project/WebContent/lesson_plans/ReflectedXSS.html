<p><b>Lesson Plan Title: </b>How to Perform Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
It is always a good practice to validate all input on the server side.
 XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response. 
 In a reflected XSS attack, an attacker can craft a URL with the attack 
 script and post it to another website, email it, or otherwise get a 
 victim to click on it. 
<!-- Stop Instructions -->
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
For this exercise, your mission is to come up with some input containing a script. You have to try to get this page to reflect that input back to your browser, which will execute the script and do something bad.
