<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b></p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
Basic Authentication is used to protect server side resources.  The web server will send a 401 authentication request with the response for the requested resource. The client side browser will then prompt the user for a user name and password using a browser supplied dialog box. The browser will base64 encode the user name and password and send those credentials back to the web server. The web server will then validate the credentials and return the requested resource if the credentials are correct. These credentials are automatically resent for each page protected with this mechanism without requiring the user to enter their credentials again.<br/>
