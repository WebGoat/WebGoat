== Self XSS or reflected XSS?

You should have been able to execute script with the last example. At this point, it would be considered 'self XSS' though.

Why is that?

That is because there is no link that would trigger that XSS.
You can try it yourself to see what happens ... go to (substitute localhost with your server's name or IP if you need to):

link: http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/CrossSiteScripting/attack5a?QTY1=1&QTY2=1&QTY3=1&QTY4=1&field1=<script>alert('my%20javascript%20here')</script>4128+3214+0002+1999&field2=111
