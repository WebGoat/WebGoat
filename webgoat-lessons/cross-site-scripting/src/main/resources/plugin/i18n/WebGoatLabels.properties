# XSS success, failure messages and hints
xss-reflected-5a-success=well done, but alerts aren't very impressive are they? Please continue.
xss-reflected-5a-failure=Try again. We do want to see this specific javascript (in case you are trying to do something more fancy)
xss-reflected-5b-success=Correct ... because <ul><li>The script was not triggered by the URL/QueryString</li><li>Even if you use the attack URL in a new tab, it won't execute (becuase of response type). Try it if you like.</li></ul>
xss-reflected-5b-failure=Nope, pretty easy to guess now though.
xss-reflected-6a-success=Correct! Now, see if you can send in an exploit to that route in the next assignment.
xss-reflected-6a-failure=No, look at the example. Check the GoatRouter.js file. It should be pretty easy to determine.
xss.lesson1.failure=Are you sure? Try using a tab from a different site.

#xss-reflected-5b-do5a-first=Do the reflected xss attack prior to this, then come back and answer this.
