=== Mitigation

In this simple example you noticed that the price is calculated client-side and sent to the server. The server
accepted the input as a given and did not calculate the price again. One of the mitigations in this case is to look up
the price of the television in your database and calculate the total price again.


In a real application you should never rely on client side validation it is important to verify all the input
send by the client. Always remember: **NEVER TRUST INPUT SEND BY A CLIENT.**
