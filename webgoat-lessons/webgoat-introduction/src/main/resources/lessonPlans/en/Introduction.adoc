== What is WebGoat?
---

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to _test vulnerabilities_
commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open source components.

Now, while we in no way condone causing intentional harm to any animal, goat or otherwise, we think learning everything
you can about security vulnerabilities is essential to understanding just what happens when even a small bit of
unintended code gets into your applications.

What better way to do that than with your very own scapegoat?

Feel free to do what you will with him. Hack, poke, prod and if it makes you feel better, scare him until your heart's content.
Go ahead, and hack the goat. We promise he likes it.

Thanks for your interest!
