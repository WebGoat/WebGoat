== National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Its mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

NIST develops Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) which the Secretary of Commerce approves and with which federal agencies must comply.

NIST also provides guidance documents and recommendations through its Special Publications (SP) 800-series.
These guidelines often become the foundation for best practice recommendations across the security industry and are incorporated into other standards.
