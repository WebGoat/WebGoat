== Authentication Bypasses

Authentication Bypasses happen in many ways, but usually take advantage of some flaw in the configuration or logic. Tampering to achieve the right conditions.

=== Hidden inputs

The simplest form is a reliance on a hidden input that is in the web page/DOM.

=== Removing Parameters

Sometimes, if an attacker doesn't know the correct value of a parameter, they may remove the parameter from the submission altogether to see what happens.

=== Forced Browsing

If an area of a site is not protected properly by configuration, that area of the site may be accessed by guessing/brute-forcing.
