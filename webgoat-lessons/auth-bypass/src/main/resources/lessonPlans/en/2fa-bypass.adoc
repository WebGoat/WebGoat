== 2FA Password Reset

A recent (2016) example (https://henryhoggard.co.uk/blog/Paypal-2FA-Bypass) is a great example of authentication bypass. He was unable to receive an SMS with a code, so he opted for the provided

=== The Scenario

You are resetting your password, but doing it from a location or device that your provider does not recognize. So you need to answer the security questions you set up.  The other issue is
that those security questions are also stored on another device (not with you) and you don't remember them.

You have already provided your username/email and opted for the alternative verification method.
