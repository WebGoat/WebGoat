NoResultsMatched=No results matched. Try Again.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a1=The application is taking your input and inserting it at the end of a pre-formed SQL command.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a2=This is the code for the query being built and issued by WebGoat:<br><br> "SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE last_name = "accountName"
SqlStringInjectionHint5a3=Compound SQL statements can be made by joining multiple tests with keywords like AND and OR. Try appending a SQL statement that always resolves to true
SqlStringInjectionHint5a4=Make sure all quotes (" ' ") are opened and closed properly.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a5=Try appending the Statement with something like: OR 1 = 1.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b1=This is the code for the query being built and issued by WebGoat:<br><br> "SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE Login_Count = "Login_Count" and User_Id = "Name"
SqlStringInjectionHint5b2=Note that you don't need to insert any quotations.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b3=Remember how you solved the previous assignment.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b4=It does not matter where you insert a statement that always resolves to true.
SqlStringInjectionHint6=Try Appending a new SQL Statement to the Query.
SqlStringInjectionHint7=The new SQL Statement can be really simple like: SELECT ... FROM ...
SqlStringInjectionHint8=Your new SQL Query should start, with a " ; " and end with " -- "
SqlStringInjectionHint9=Try sorting and look at the request
SqlStringInjectionHint10=Intercept the request and try to specify a different order by
SqlStringInjectionHint11=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens
SqlStringInjectionHint12=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens
