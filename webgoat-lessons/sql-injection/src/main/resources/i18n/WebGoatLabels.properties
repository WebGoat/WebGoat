#StringSqlInjection.java
StringSqlInjectionSecondStage=Now that you have successfully performed an SQL injection, try the same type of attack on a parameterized query.  Restart the lesson if you wish to return to the injectable query.
EnterLastName=Enter your last name:

sql.injection.title=SQL Injection (introduction)
sql.mitigation.title=SQL Injection (mitigation)
sql.advanced.title=SQL Injection (advanced)


NoResultsMatched=No results matched. Try Again.
SqlStringInjectionHint6=Try Appending a new SQL Statement to the Query.
SqlStringInjectionHint7=The new SQL Statement can be really simple like: SELECT ... FROM ...
SqlStringInjectionHint8=Your new SQL Query should start, with a " ; " and end with " -- "
SqlStringInjectionHint9=Try sorting and look at the request
SqlStringInjectionHint10=Intercept the request and try to specify a different order by
SqlStringInjectionHint11=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens
SqlStringInjectionHint12=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens

sql-injection.6a.success=You have succeed: {0}
sql-injection.6a.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.

sql-injection.6b.success=You have succeed: {0}
sql-injection.6b.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.

sql-injection.8.success=You have succeeded! You successfully compromised the confidentiality of data by viewing internal information that you should not have access to. Well done! {0}
sql-injection.8.no.results=No employee found with matching lastname. Or maybe your authentication TAN is incorrect?
sql-injection.9.success=Well done! Now you're earning the most money. And at the same time you successfully compromised the integrity of data by changing the salary! {0}
sql-injection.10.success=Success! You successfully deleted the access_log table and that way compromised the availability of the data.

SqlStringInjectionHint8-1=The application is taking your input and inserting the values into the variables 'name' and 'auth_tan' of the pre-formed SQL command.
SqlStringInjectionHint8-2=Compound SQL statements can be made by expanding the WHERE clause of the statement with keywords like AND and OR.
SqlStringInjectionHint8-3=Try appending a SQL statement that always resolves to true.
SqlStringInjectionHint8-4=Make sure all quotes (" ' ") are opened and closed properly so the resulting SQL query is syntactically correct.
SqlStringInjectionHint8-5=Try extending the WHERE clause of the statement by adding something like: ' OR '1' = '1.

SqlStringInjectionHint9-1=Try to find a way, to chain another query to the end of the existing one.
SqlStringInjectionHint9-2=Use the ; metacharacter to do so.
SqlStringInjectionHint9-3=Make use of DML to change your salary.
SqlStringInjectionHint9-4=Make sure that the resulting query is syntactically correct.
SqlStringInjectionHint9-5=How about something like '; UPDATE employees....

SqlStringInjectionHint10-1=Use the techniques that you have learned before.
SqlStringInjectionHint10-2=The application takes your input and filters for entries that are LIKE it.
SqlStringInjectionHint10-3=Try query chaining to reach the goal.
SqlStringInjectionHint10-4=The DDL allows you to delete (DROP) database tables.
SqlStringInjectionHint10-5=The underlying sql query looks like that: "SELECT * FROM access_log WHERE action LIKE '%" + action + "%'".
SqlStringInjectionHint10-6=Remember that you can use the -- metacharacter to comment out the rest of the line.
