SqlInjectionChallenge1=Look at the different response you receive from the server
SqlInjectionChallenge2=The vulnerability is on the register form
SqlInjectionChallenge3=Use tooling to automate this attack
sql-injection.error=<span class='feedback-negative'>Sorry, this solution is not correct. Try again!</span>
NoResultsMatched=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>
ResultsButNotTom=<span class='feedback-negative'>Try To login as Tom!</span>

sql-injection.2.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded!</span>
sql-injection.2.failed=<span class='feedback-negative'>Something went wrong! You got no results, check your SQL Statement and the table above.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint2-1=You want the data from the column with the name department. You know the database name (employees) and you know the first- and lastname of the employee (first_name, last_name).
SqlStringInjectionHint2-2=SELECT column FROM tablename WHERE condition;
SqlStringInjectionHint2-3=Use ' instead of " when comparing two strings.
SqlStringInjectionHint2-4=Pay attention to case sensitivity when comparing two strings.

SqlStringInjectionHint3-1=Try the UPDATE statement
SqlStringInjectionHint3-2=UPDATE table name SET column name=value WHERE condition;

SqlStringInjectionHint4-1=ALTER TABLE alters the structure of an existing database
SqlStringInjectionHint4-2=Do not forget the data type of the new column (e.g. varchar(size) or int(size))
SqlStringInjectionHint4-3=ALTER TABLE table name ADD column name data type(size);

SqlStringInjectionHint5-a=Look at the example. There is everything you will need.

sql-injection.5a.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded: {0}</span>
sql-injection.5a.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint5a1=Remember that for an successful Sql-Injection the query needs to always evaluate to <span style="font-style: italic">true</span>.

sql-injection.5b.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded: {0}</span>
sql-injection.5b.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint5b1=Try to check which of the input fields is susceptible to an injection attack.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b2=Insert: <span style="font-style: italic">0 or 1 = 1</span> into the first input field. The output should tell you if this field is injectable.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b3=The first input field is not susceptible to sql injection.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b4=You do not need to insert any quotations into your injection-string.

sql-injection.6a.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded: {0}</span>
sql-injection.6a.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>

sql-injection.advanced.6a.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded: {0}</span>
sql-injection.advanced.6a.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint-advanced-6a-1=Remember that when using an UNION each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
SqlStringInjectionHint-advanced-6a-2=The data type of a column in the first SELECT statement must have a similar data type to that in the second SELECT statement.
SqlStringInjectionHint-advanced-6a-3=Your new SQL query must end with a comment. eg: --
SqlStringInjectionHint-advanced-6a-4=If a column needs a String you could substitute something like <span style="font-style: italic">'a String'</span> for it. For integers you could substitute a <span style="font-style: italic">1</span>.
SqlStringInjectionHint-advanced-6a-5=Try something like: <span style="font-style: italic">Smith' UNION SELECT userid,user_name, password, 'a', 'b', 'c', 1 from user_system_data --</span>

sql-injection.6b.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded: {0}</span>
sql-injection.6b.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No results matched. Try Again.</span>

sql-injection.8.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You have succeeded! You successfully compromised the confidentiality of data by viewing internal information that you should not have access to. Well done!</span>
sql-injection.8.no.results=<span class='feedback-negative'>No employee found with matching last name. Or maybe your authentication TAN is incorrect?</span>
sql-injection.8.one=<span class='feedback-negative'>That is only one account. You want them all! Try again.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint.8.1=The application is taking your input and inserting the values into the variables 'name' and 'auth_tan' of the pre-formed SQL command.
SqlStringInjectionHint.8.2=Compound SQL statements can be made by expanding the WHERE clause of the statement with keywords like AND and OR.
SqlStringInjectionHint.8.3=Try appending a SQL statement that always resolves to true.
SqlStringInjectionHint.8.4=Make sure all quotes (" ' ") are opened and closed properly so the resulting SQL query is syntactically correct.
SqlStringInjectionHint.8.5=Try extending the WHERE clause of the statement by adding something like: ' OR '1' = '1.

sql-injection.9.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>Well done! Now you are earning the most money. And at the same time you successfully compromised the integrity of data by changing the salary!</span>
sql-injection.9.one=<span class='feedback-negative'>Still not earning enough! Better try again and change that.</span>
SqlStringInjectionHint.9.1=Try to find a way, to chain another query to the end of the existing one.
SqlStringInjectionHint.9.2=Use the ; metacharacter to do so.
SqlStringInjectionHint.9.3=Make use of DML to change your salary.
SqlStringInjectionHint.9.4=Make sure that the resulting query is syntactically correct.
SqlStringInjectionHint.9.5=How about something like '; UPDATE employees....

sql-injection.10.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>Success! You successfully deleted the access_log table and that way compromised the availability of the data.</span>
sql-injection.10.entries=<span class='feedback-negative'>There is still evidence of what you did. Better remove the whole table.</span>

sql-injection.10b.success=<span class='feedback-positive'>You did it! Your code can prevent an SQL injection attack!</span>
sql-injection.10b.failed=<span class='feedback-negative'>Something does not seem right with that code. Maybe you should look at an example how to prevent SQL injections with JDBC?</span>
sql-injection.10b.no-code=<span class='feedback-negative'>You need to write some code.</span>
sql-injection.10b.compiler-errors=<span class='feedback-negative'>Could not compile code:</span>

SqlStringInjectionHint.10.1=Use the techniques that you have learned before.
SqlStringInjectionHint.10.2=The application takes your input and filters for entries that are LIKE it.
SqlStringInjectionHint.10.3=Try query chaining to reach the goal.
SqlStringInjectionHint.10.4=The DDL allows you to delete (DROP) database tables.
SqlStringInjectionHint.10.5=The underlying SQL query looks like that: "SELECT * FROM access_log WHERE action LIKE '%" + action + "%'".
SqlStringInjectionHint.10.6=Remember that you can use the -- metacharacter to comment out the rest of the line.

SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10a-1=First establish a connection, after that you can create a statement.
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10a-2=For every data type there is a method to insert values into a wildcard symbol in a statement.

SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10b-1=A database connection has to be surrounded by a try-catch block to handle the very common case of an error while establishing the connection.
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10b-2=Remember to use the right kind of statement, so your code is no longer vulnerable for SQL injections.
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10b-3=The wildcard symbol '?' in a prepared statement can be filled with the right kind of method. There exists one for every data type.
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10b-4=Make sure to execute your statement.
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-10b-5=View the previous lesson to check back on how you can build set up a connection.

SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-13-1=Try sorting and look at the request
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-13-2=Intercept the request and try to specify a different order by
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-13-3=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens
SqlStringInjectionHint-mitigation-13-4=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens

SqlInjectionChallengeHint1=The table name is randomized at each start of WebGoat, try to figure out the name first.
SqlInjectionChallengeHint2=Find the field which is vulnerable to SQL injection use that to change the password.
SqlInjectionChallengeHint3=Change the password through an UPDATE Statement.
SqlInjectionChallengeHint4=The vulnerable field is the username field of the register form.

SqlOnlyInputValidation-failed=Using spaces is not allowed!
SqlOnlyInputValidation-1=Spaces are rejected, try to find a way around this restriction
SqlOnlyInputValidation-2=Try to use a comment in the query
SqlOnlyInputValidation-3=WebGoat uses HSQLDB as a database can you use one of them to make skip the filtering?

SqlOnlyInputValidationOnKeywords-failed=Use of spaces and/or SQL keywords are not allowed!
SqlOnlyInputValidationOnKeywords-1=Spaces are and SQL keywords are rejected, try to find a way around this restriction
SqlOnlyInputValidationOnKeywords-2=Try to use a comment in the query
SqlOnlyInputValidationOnKeywords-3=WebGoat uses HSQLDB as a database can you use one of them to make skip the filtering?
