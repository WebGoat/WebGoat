== Compromising Availability
After successfully compromising confidentiality and integrity in the previous lessons, we are now going to compromise the third element of the CIA triad: *availability*.

There are many different ways to violate availability.
If an account is deleted or its password gets changed, the actual owner cannot access this account anymore.
Attackers could also try to delete parts of the database, or even drop the whole database, in order to make the data inaccessible. 
Revoking the access rights of admins or other users is yet another way to compromise availability; this would prevent these users from accessing either specific parts of the database or even the entire database as a whdle.

=== It is your turn!
Now you are the top earner in your company.
But do you see that?
There seems to be a *access_log* table, where all your actions have been logged to! +
Better go and _delete it_ completely before anyone notices.
