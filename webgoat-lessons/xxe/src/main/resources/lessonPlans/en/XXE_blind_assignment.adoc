== Blind XXE assignment

In the previous page we showed you how you can ping a server with a XXE attack, in this assignment try to make a DTD which will upload the contents of a file secret.txt from the WebGoat server to our WebWolf server. You can use WebWolf to serve your DTD. The secret.txt is located on the WebGoat server in this location, so you do not need to scan all directories and files:


|===
|OS |Location

|`operatingSystem:os[]`
|`webGoatTempDir:temppath[]/XXE/secret.txt`

|===

Try to upload this file using WebWolf landing page for example: `webWolfRootLink:landing?text=contents_file[noLink,target=landing]`
(NOTE: this endpoint is under your full control)
Once you obtained the contents of the file post it as a new comment on the page and you will solve the lesson.
