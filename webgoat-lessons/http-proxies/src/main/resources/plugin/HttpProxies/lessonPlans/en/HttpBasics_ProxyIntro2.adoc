== HTTP Proxy Setup: The Browser

=== Point Browser at Proxy

There are many plugins to manage this, but this will show you how to do this manually in Firefox and Chrome.
This will send all of your traffic to the proxy. Since we haven't set up a trusted cert. yet, that may cause issues with any https requests. More on that in a bit though. Let's stick to basics for now:

==== Firefox Proxy Config

. Go to your Firefox Preferences (Mac, Linux) or Options (Windows) from the menu.
. Select _Advanced_ on the left
. Select _Network_ in the in Advanced Pane
. Click _Settings_
. Select _Manual proxy configuration_
.. input *127.0.0.1* as the Proxy
.. input *8090* as the port
.. check the _Use this proxy server for all protocols_ checkbox

==== Chrome Proxy Config

. Bring up Chrome's settings form the menu
. In the _Search settings_ box type in *proxy* and hit Enter/Return. This should bring up the Network heading with a _Change proxy settings_ button.
. Click the _Change proxy settings_ button
. Select the _proxies_ tab
. Select Web Proxy (HTTP)
. Input 127..0.0.1 in the first box under _Web Proxy Server_ and your port # (8090 is what used earlier) in the second box (to the right)
. You may also want to clear the _Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains_ text input at the bottom, but shouldn't need to
