= HTTP Basics : Proxy
 
== HTTP Proxy Setup

HTTP Proxies are tools that allow an attacker, developer or researcher to act as a man-in-the-middle on requests and responses. Since this is an
OWASP project, we'll be using ZAP. If you are comfortable using another proxy (e.g. Burp), you can skip this. Otherwise,
this will show you how to set up ZAP to act as a proxy on your localhost.

=== Setting up ZAP

Once you have 'installed' ZAP (you don't really install it, just unpack it and run it locally), we will need to:

* Start ZAP
* Configure the local proxy port
* Point the browser at the proxy

=== Start ZAP
When ZAP starts, you will be presented with a dialog such as the one below ...

=== Configure Proxy's Port

. Select Tools > Options from the menu
. Select Local Proxy on the left
. Choose an available port ... Since WebGoat is using port 8080, use something different like 8090
. Click OK
