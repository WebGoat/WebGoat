=== Welcome to the WebGoat challenge (CTF)

==== Introduction

The challenges contain more a CTF like lessons where we do not provide any explanations what you need to do, no hints
will be provided. You can use these challenges in a CTF style where you can run WebGoat on one server and all
participants can join and hack the challenges. A scoreboard is available at http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/scoreboard

:hardbreaks:
In this CTF you will need to solve a couple of challenges, each challenge will give you a flag which you will
need to post in order to gain points.

Flags have the following format: `a7179f89-906b-4fec-9d99-f15b796e7208`

==== Rules

- Do not try to hack the competition infrastructure. If you happen to find a bug or vulnerability please send us
an e-mail.

- Play fair, do not try sabotage other competing teams, or in any way hindering the progress of another team.

- Brute forcing of challenges / flags is not allowed.
