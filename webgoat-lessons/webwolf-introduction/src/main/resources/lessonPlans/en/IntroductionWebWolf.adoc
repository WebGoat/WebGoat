== Introducing WebWolf

You only need WebWolf if a lesson specifies you can use it. For a lot of lessons you use WebGoat without
starting WebWolf. If you need to do an exercise with WebWolf make sure it is running along side WebGoat. Lessons
where you can use WebWolf are marked with the following icon (top right in assignment):

Even if the icon is present your are not obliged to use WebWolf, you can also use any intercepting tool you like.
(`netcat` etc.)

WebWolf is a separate web application which simulates an attackers machine. It makes it possible for us to
make a clear distinction between what takes place on the attacked website and the actions you need to do as
an "attacker". WebWolf was introduced after a couple of workshops where we received feedback that there
was no clear distinction between what was part of the "attackers" role and what was part of the "users" role on the
website. The following items are supported in WebWolf:

* Hosting a file
* Receiving email
* Landing page for incoming requests

WebWolf runs as a separate web application. If you are using the Docker-compose file you can just point your browser webWolfLink:here[] to open WebWolf.
If you want to use the standalone version, you will need to download the jar file and start it:

```
java -jar webwolf-<<version>>.jar [--server.port=9090] [--server.address=localhost]
```

By default WebWolf starts on port 9090 with `--server.port` you can specify a different port. With `server.address` you
can bind it to a different address (default localhost)

Note: if you start WebGoat as standalone application you need to start WebWolf as standalone application as well.


This will start the application on port 9090, click webWolfLink:here[] to open WebWolf.
The first thing you need to do is login with the user you registered on WebGoat.
