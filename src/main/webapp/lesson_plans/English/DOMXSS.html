<p><b>Lesson Plan Title: </b>DOM Based Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
The Document Object Model (DOM) presents an interesting problem from
a security standpoint.  It allows the content of a web page to be dynamically
modified, but that can be abused by attackers during a malicious code injection.  XSS,
a type of malicious code injection, can occur when unvalidated user input is used directly
to modify the content of a page on the client side.

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
For this exercise, your mission is to use this vulnerability to inject
malicious code into the DOM.  Then in the last stage, you will correct
the flaws in the code to address the vulnerability.
