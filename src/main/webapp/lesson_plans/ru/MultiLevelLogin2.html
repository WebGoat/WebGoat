<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Multi Level Login 2</p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
A Multi Level Login should provide a strong authentication. 
This is archived by adding a second layer. After having 
logged in with your user name and password you are asked
for a 'Transaction Authentication Number' (TAN). This is 
often used by online banking. You get a list with a lots 
of TANs generated only for you by the bank. Each TAN is used only once. 
Another method is to provide the TAN by SMS. This has
the advantage that an attacker can not get TANs provided
by the user.
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
In this lesson you have to try to break into another account. 
You have an own account for WebGoat Financial but you want to
log into another account only knowing the user name of the victim
to attack.
