How to steal a session with a 'Session Fixation'

<p>
<b>How the attacks works:</b>
</p>
A user is recognized by the server by an unique Session ID. If a
user has logged in and is authorized he does not have to 
reauthorize when he revisits the application as the user is recognized
by the Session ID. In some applications it is possible to deliver
the Session ID in the Get-Request. Here is where the attack starts.
<br><br>
An attacker can send a hyperlink to a victim with a chosen Session ID.
This can be done for example by a prepared mail which looks like an 
official mail from the application administrator.
If the victim clicks on the link and logs in he is authorized
by the Session ID the attacker has chosen. The attacker
can visit the page with the same ID and is recognized as the victim and
gets logged in without authorization.
