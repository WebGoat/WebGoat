#BasicAuthentication.java
BasicAuthHeaderNameIncorrect=Basic Authentication header name is incorrect.
BasicAuthHeaderValueIncorrect=Basic Authentication header value is incorrect.
BasicAuthenticationWhatIsNameOfHeader=What is the name of the authentication header:
BasicAuthenticationWhatIsDecodedValueOfHeader=What is the decoded value of the authentication header:
Submit=Submit
BasicAuthenticationGreenStars1=Close your browser and login as 
BasicAuthenticationGreenStars2= to get your green stars back.
BasicAuthenticationStage1Completed=Congratulations, you have figured out the mechanics of basic authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;- Now you must try to make WebGoat reauthenticate you as:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- username:  basic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- password:  basic. Use the Basic Authentication Menu to start at login page.
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere1=You're almost there!  You've modified the 
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere2= header but you are still logged in as 
BasicAuthenticationAlmostThere3=.  Look at the request after you typed in the 'basic' user credentials and submitted the request.  Remember the order of events that occur during Basic Authentication.
BasicAuthenticationReallyClose=You're really close!  Changing the session cookie caused the server to create a new session for you.  This did not cause the server to reauthenticate you. When you figure out how to force the server to perform an authentication request, you have to authenticate as:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user name: basic<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password: basic<br>
BasicAuthenticationUseTheHints=Use the hints!  One at a time...

BasicAuthenticationHint1=Basic authentication uses a cookie to pass the credentials. Use a proxy to intercept the request.  Look at the cookies.
		
BasicAuthenticationHint2=Basic authentication uses Base64 encoding to 'scramble' the " + "user's login credentials.
BasicAuthenticationHint3=Basic authentication uses 'Authorization' as the cookie name to " + "store the user's credentials.
BasicAuthenticationHint4=Use WebScarab -> Tools -> Transcoder to Base64 decode the value in the Authorization cookie.

BasicAuthenticationHint5=Basic authentication uses a cookie to pass the credentials. Use a proxy to intercept the request.  Look at the cookies.
BasicAuthenticationHint6=Before the WebServer requests credentials from the client, the current session is checked for validitity.
BasicAuthenticationHint7=If the session is invalid the webserver will use the basic authentication credentials
BasicAuthenticationHint8=If the session is invalid and the basic authentication credentials are invalid, new credentials will be requested from the client.
BasicAuthenticationHint9=Intercept the request and corrupt the JSESSIONID and the Authorization header.
