== Architecture Information

=== What's important?

* Is my component old or is it stable
* Is my component unpopular
* Was my lack of upgrade a deliberate choice or a lack of knowledge

=== Summary

* It's really difficult to keep components up to date
 
For the components analyzed in 25,000 applications it was found that:

*  8% of  2 year old components did not have a newer version
* 23% of 11 year old components did not have a newer version
* Older components make up the majority of the risk
