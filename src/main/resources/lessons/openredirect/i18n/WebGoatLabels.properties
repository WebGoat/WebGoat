openredirect.title=Open Redirect Vulnerabilities

# Task 1 labels
openredirect.success1=You exploited the open redirect! External host accepted.
openredirect.failure1=The application did not redirect externally yet.
openredirect.hint1=Try using a full absolute URL starting with http:// or https://
openredirect.hint2=Internal hosts (webgoat.local, localhost) will not count as success.

# Task 2 labels
openredirect.success2=Naive substring filter bypassed.
openredirect.failure2=Bypass not achieved, host still considered allowed or input invalid.
openredirect.hint3=Include the word 'webgoat' but control the real host.
openredirect.hint4=Consider userinfo (@) or subdomains like webgoat.org.evil.com.

# Task 3 labels
openredirect.success3=Normalization bypass achieved.
openredirect.failure3=Normalization bypass not yet successful.
openredirect.hint5=The code only checks the string prefix after decode.
openredirect.hint6=Try a userinfo (@) based payload so real host differs.

# Task 4 labels (double decode)
openredirect.success4=Double decoding revealed external host.
openredirect.failure4=Double decode bypass not achieved yet.
openredirect.hint7=Encode the '@' twice using %25 so the first decode leaves %40.
openredirect.hint8=Your first decoded host must be internal while the second decoded host is external.

# Mitigation testing labels
openredirect.mitigation.success=Mitigation effective: external host blocked and safe internal path chosen.
openredirect.mitigation.failure=Mitigation test not satisfied yet.
openredirect.mitigation.hint1=Try an absolute external URL (http/https) that is NOT an internal host.
openredirect.mitigation.hint2=Internal hosts (webgoat.local, localhost) will not demonstrate mitigation.

# Quiz labels
openredirect.quiz.success=Great! You understand the open redirect risks and mitigations.
openredirect.quiz.failure=Some answers are incorrect. Review the explanation pages and try again.
