== Bypass a naive substring filter

A developer attempted a quick fix: reject any redirect unless the supplied URL contains the substring `webgoat`.

This is NOT a proper allow list.

Goal:

* Craft a URL which contains the substring `webgoat` but whose real host is NOT one of the allowed hosts: `webgoat.local`, `webgoat.org`, `localhost`.

Examples that should work:

* `https://webgoat.org.evil.com`
* `https://webgoat.local.attacker.net`
* `https://webgoat.org@evil.com/path`

On success you will see confirmation that the naive filter was bypassed.
