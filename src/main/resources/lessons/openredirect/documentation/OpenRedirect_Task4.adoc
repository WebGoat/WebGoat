== Double encoding bypass

Some filters only decode a parameter once before validating a prefix. If user input is decoded a second time later (by a framework component, a proxy, logging pipeline, etc.) the real target can change.

Goal:

* Supply a URL which after ONE decode appears to start with the trusted host `https://webgoat.local` but after TWO decodes the actual parsed host is attacker-controlled.

Technique:

* Encode the `@` sign twice so the first decode leaves an encoded version in place (`%40`) and only the second decode reveals the userinfo separator.

Example idea:

* `https://webgoat.local%2540evil.com`
  * 1st decode -> `https://webgoat.local%40evil.com` (still looks internal to naive prefix check)
  * 2nd decode -> `https://webgoat.local@evil.com` (real host = `evil.com`)

On success the debug output will show:

* AppearsInternalAfter1: true
* 1st host is internal
* 2nd host is external

Try variations with other characters (`%252F` => `%2F` etc.) to see how multiple decodes can reshape a URL.
