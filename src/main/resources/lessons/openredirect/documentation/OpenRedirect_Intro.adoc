= Open Redirects

An Open Redirect occurs when an application allows user-controlled data to influence a redirect destination without adequate validation.

Attackers abuse this to:

* Facilitate phishing (trusted domain -> attacker domain)
* Leak tokens or secret query parameters
* Chain through intermediate redirects to hide final destination

In the next tasks you'll exploit progressively "fixed" code.
