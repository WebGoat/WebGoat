== Challenge – flawed normalization

A new "fix" attempts to treat anything starting with `http(s)://webgoat.local` as trusted after a single decode and lowercase.

However, URLs can include a userinfo part before the `@` sign. The code only checks the string prefix. It does not verify the real host.

Goal:

* Supply a value that appears to start with the trusted host but whose real host (after parsing) is external.

Try payload ideas:

* `https://webgoat.local@evil.com`  (userinfo trick)
* `https://webgoat.local.evil.com`  (subdomain – may or may not pass prefix test depending on code)
* Encoded userinfo: `https://webgoat.local%40evil.com` (if additional normalization were present)

You succeed when the debug output shows `AppearsInternal: true` but `RealHost` is an external domain.
