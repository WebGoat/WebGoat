== Basic open redirect

The application takes a user-supplied `returnUrl` (here simply named `url`) and would normally issue a redirect without validation.

Goal:

* Provide an absolute external URL using `http` or `https` that is NOT one of the internal hosts: `webgoat.local`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`.

Try:

* `https://evil.test`
* `http://attacker.example`
