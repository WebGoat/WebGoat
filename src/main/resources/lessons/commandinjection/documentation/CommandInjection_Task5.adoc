=== Sandbox the diagnostics

You now control the diagnostics console. The team proposed three switches:

*Execution mode*

- Shell – legacy behaviour that spawns `/bin/sh -c` / `cmd.exe /c`
- Direct process – use `ProcessBuilder` without a shell
- Allowlist only – run commands strictly from a fixed list

*Command allowlist* – enables the predefined safe commands (hostname, uptime).

*Input sanitiser* – strips the obvious separators.

Find the combination that allows the legitimate status check to run while preventing the command
injections from earlier tasks. Submit your configuration to verify the fix.

Secure remediation relies on removing the shell and enforcing a tight allowlist. A deny list and
sanitisers are insufficient by themselves.
