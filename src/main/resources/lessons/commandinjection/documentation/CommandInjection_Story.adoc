=== Command Injection: Pipe Dream

Operations rolled out a "diagnostics" feature that shells out to the host OS whenever a
support engineer needs quick status. Instead of limiting commands, the service forwards your
input straight to `Runtime.exec(...)`.

Your mission:

* Locate the injection point.
* Escalate from benign diagnostics to arbitrary command execution.
* Leak the secrets the operator forgot to hide.
* Lock the console down by removing shell invocation and enforcing allow lists.

Each task shows how a small oversight leads to full compromise — and how to mitigate it.
