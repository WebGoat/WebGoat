=== Safety First

These exercises execute real commands on the machine running WebGoat. If you are running the
standalone JAR on your workstation, a malformed input could leave processes running or modify
files. We strongly suggest using the Docker container for this lesson so you can tear down the
environment after experimenting.

Type the sentence below to acknowledge the risk and continue:

`I understand commands will execute`
