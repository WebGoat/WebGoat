=== Recon – What command is running?

Before we start breaking things, figure out what the diagnostics console is actually executing.
Pick a host from the dropdown or provide a custom value. The backend will run a system command
and show you the exact string it sent to the shell.

Steps:

. Try the default host to see the “safe” command.
. Observe the command preview returned by the server.
. Submit the exact command string in the verification box to prove you understand how the
  wrapper works.

Knowing the command layout is the first step to crafting payloads.
