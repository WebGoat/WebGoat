=== Chain commands to leak system info

The diagnostics console concatenates your input with a shell command. Try appending a new
command (for example, with `;` or `&&`) that prints the environment variable
`WEBGOAT_BUILD_TOKEN`. The backend will show you the raw output.

Steps:

. Use the console to run a normal diagnostic.
. Append a chained command that echoes the token (e.g., `; echo $WEBGOAT_BUILD_TOKEN` on Linux or
  `&& echo %WEBGOAT_BUILD_TOKEN%` on Windows).
. Copy the leaked build token from the output and submit it below.

If you can chain commands, you can run anything the service account can.
