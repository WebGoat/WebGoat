=== Escalate – Read the Flag

The cat gallery looks innocuous: when you type a name in the search box it simply runs

Unfortunately the search term is injected into the shell command verbatim.
Add a separator (`;`, `&&`) and the shell will happily execute whatever else you append under the service account.

Attackers follow this exact pattern to dump environment variables, API keys, and other secrets once they uncover a command injection primitive.
