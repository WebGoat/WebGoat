=== What Is Command Injection?

Command injection happens when user-controlled data is passed to an operating system shell
without strict validation or parameterization. The application may wrap the input in helper
commands (`ping`, `cat`, `dir`), but because it delegates to `/bin/sh`, `cmd.exe`, or another
shell, an attacker can break out of the intended command and execute anything the running
process is allowed to run.

Common reasons this surfaces:

* Using `Runtime.exec`, `ProcessBuilder`, or `popen` with concatenated strings.
* Trusting user input when building command-line arguments (think backup scripts or log
  viewers that shell out).
* Attempting to sanitise by stripping a few metacharacters, but missing others.

The impact depends on the privileges of the application user. At minimum, attackers can
read data, pivot into the local network, or drop backdoors. In worst cases, they gain full
control of the host.

In the following tasks you’ll see how a tiny “diagnostic” feature snowballs into arbitrary
code execution—and how to harden it.
