=== Filter Bypass – Leak the API Key

Operations noticed people chaining commands and added a quick denylist: the server now strips
`;`, `&&`, and `|` from your cat search before sending it to the shell. The diags console still runs
`grep $title images/*`, so you need a separator that survives.

At startup the lesson stores an API key for you in
`command-injection/task4/<username>/api-key.txt`. Bypass the filter, read the file, and enter the key
below to finish the task.

The filter only scrubs a few obvious characters—construct a payload using substitution syntax (for
example, `$(...)`) or inject a newline to run your command.
