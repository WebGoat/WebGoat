commandinjection.title=Command Injection
commandinjection.task1.hint1=Look at the command preview; it shows exactly what the server runs.
commandinjection.task1.hint2=Submitting the command string proves you understand the wrapper. Try combining dropdown and custom input.
commandinjection.task1.success=Command recognised! Now that you know the wrapper, plan your payloads.
commandinjection.task1.failure.empty=Paste the command string you observed before submitting.
commandinjection.task1.failure.mismatch=The observed command does not match what was executed. Check the preview again.
commandinjection.safety.hint1=This lesson runs shell commands. If possible use the Docker container to stay isolated.
commandinjection.safety.success=Thanks for acknowledging the risk. Continue to the diagnostics console.
commandinjection.safety.failure=Please type the exact acknowledgement before proceeding.
commandinjection.task2.hint1=Start with the same diagnostic command the service expects, then chain your payload (e.g., using ; or &&).
commandinjection.task2.hint2=All fields start empty—supply the base command, your chained payload, and the token you discover in the output.
commandinjection.task2.success=Great! You chained commands and leaked the token.
commandinjection.task2.failure.blank=Provide the build token from the command output.
commandinjection.task2.failure.mismatch=That token does not match the leaked value. Try again.
commandinjection.task3.hint1=Start with a normal search (e.g., Luna) to see how grep $title images/* maps to the cat metadata files.
commandinjection.task3.hint2=The flag lives in command-injection/<username>/flag.txt. When the working directory is set up for you, that file is reachable as plain flag.txt, so use cat/type after your search to dump it.
commandinjection.task3.hint3=Keep the grep happy by injecting the images/* glob before your separator; otherwise grep waits on STDIN and times out.
commandinjection.task3.hint4=After cat prints the flag, comment out the template tail (e.g., ; #) so the extra images/* from the wrapper does not run. Submit the token.
commandinjection.task3.success=Flag captured! You now have proof the shell executes arbitrary commands.
commandinjection.task3.failure.blank=Fetch the flag token from the output before submitting.
commandinjection.task3.failure.invalid=That token does not match the flag. Try executing the cat command again.
commandinjection.task3.failure.payload=Enter a cat name (or your exploit) before running the search.
