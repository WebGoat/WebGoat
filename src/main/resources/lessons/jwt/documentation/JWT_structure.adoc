== Structure of a JWT token

Let's take a look at the structure of a JWT token:

[role="lesson-image"]
image::images/jwt_token.png[JWT]

The token is base64 encoded and consists of three parts:

 - header
 - claims
 - signature

Both header and claims consist are respresented by a JSON object. The header describes the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT and optionally, additional properties of the JWT.
The claims represent a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT.
