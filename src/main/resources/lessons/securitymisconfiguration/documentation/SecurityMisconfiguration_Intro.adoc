== Security Misconfiguration

Misconfiguration is one of the fastest ways to lose control of an otherwise solid
application. Debug flags that never get switched off, default accounts that ship with
admin rights, staging consoles that remain reachable from production. They are all
examples of configuration debt waiting to be exploited.

In this lesson you will wear both hats: attacker and defender. Each task exposes a
setting that should have been hardened before go-live. Your job is to:

* Find the misconfiguration via light reconnaissance,
* Demonstrate the impact (exploit the weakness), and then
* Note the remediation so it can be permanently fixed.
