=== Exposed Actuator endpoints

The operations team left the actuator endpoints wide open. Anyone on the internet can hit
`/actuator/env` and `/actuator/health` without authentication, leaking internal secrets and
status information.

Steps:

. Query the exposed endpoints using the buttons below.
. Inspect the JSON response and locate the system API key.
. Submit the leaked key to complete the task and note the remediation: lock down or
  disable actuator endpoints, or protect them with authentication and network filters.

If an attacker can reach these maintenance endpoints, they can pivot into sensitive
configuration data or even trigger dangerous actions.

Once misconfigured endpoints expose environment variables, tokens, or health data, an attacker can pivot into other APIs, replay leaked secrets, or gather intel for further compromise. Restrict actuator/admin consoles to trusted networks, enforce authentication, and disable sensitive endpoints in production.
