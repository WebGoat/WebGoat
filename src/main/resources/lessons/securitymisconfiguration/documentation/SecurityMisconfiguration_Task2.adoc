=== Verbose Debug Mode Leakage

The staging build was shipped with **debug mode enabled**. When the application throws an
exception, Spring now returns full stack traces â€” including environment variables and
API secrets.

Steps:

. Trigger the failing controller using the button below.
. Inspect the returned stack trace and locate the leaked database credentials and system token.
. Use the leaked token to call the `/config` endpoint below and observe the sensitive configuration.
. Submit the token to confirm exploitation and note the remediation: disable debug
  mode (and never expose stack traces to end users).

Remember: detailed errors belong in logs, not in production responses.
