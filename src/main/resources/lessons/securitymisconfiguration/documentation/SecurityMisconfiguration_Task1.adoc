=== Default credentials still active

We start with something depressingly common: default credentials left enabled in
production.

Operations pushed the staging build straight to production and forgot to remove the
factory admin account. Can you authenticate using the vendor default credentials?

Steps to try:

. Look for banner text, comments, or documentation shipped with the interface.
. Try the classic combinations (`admin/admin`, `root/password`, `support/support`, ...).
. Once you get in, capture a screenshot or note the profile information â€” it proves the
  account is live.

When you succeed the panel below will confirm the compromise and remind you why default
accounts must be disabled or forced to rotate on first boot.
