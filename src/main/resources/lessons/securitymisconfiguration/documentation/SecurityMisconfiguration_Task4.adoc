=== Harden the configuration

Operations has agreed to fix the earlier issues, but the configuration file is still a mess.
Use the form below (a simplified `application.properties`) to set the key hardening values:

. Disable the `/actuator/env` endpoint (`management.endpoint.env.enabled=false`).
. Hide health details from unauthenticated users (`management.endpoint.health.show-details=never`).
. Remove the embedded default admin user (leave username/password empty).

Submit the values to confirm the configuration is hardened. In the real world you would place
these settings into source control and automated environment templates.
