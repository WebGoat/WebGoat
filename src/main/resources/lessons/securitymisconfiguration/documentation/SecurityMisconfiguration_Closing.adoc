A secure deployment is more than writing safe code — it’s making sure the platform is hardened every time it rolls out.
In this lesson you exploited and then fixed four common mistakes:

* **Default credentials** left enabled.
Remove vendor accounts, force rotation on first boot, and tie access to centralized identity.
* **Verbose debug errors** in production.
Send stack traces to logs, not users; expose friendly messages only.
* **Exposed actuator/admin consoles.** Restrict management endpoints to trusted networks and require authentication.
* **Configuration hardening.** Disable endpoints you do not need, hide health details, and blank out embedded admin accounts so they can’t come back.

Carry these checks into your delivery pipeline:

* Keep an inventory of configuration baselines per environment.
* Automate hardening with infrastructure-as-code and configuration scans.
* Treat staging flags as temporary — ensure they drop off before promotion.
* Audit changes regularly so drift doesn’t reintroduce the same vulnerabilities.

When security misconfiguration sneaks in, attackers don’t have to break crypto or discover new exploits — they simply take what the platform already exposes.
Stay disciplined about configuration hygiene, and you remove one of their easiest paths in.
