<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Bypass Client Side JavaScript Validation </p>
</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
Client-side validation should not be considered a secure means of validating parameters. These validations only help reduce the amount of server processing time for normal users who do not know the format of required input. Attackers can bypass these mechanisms easily in various ways.
