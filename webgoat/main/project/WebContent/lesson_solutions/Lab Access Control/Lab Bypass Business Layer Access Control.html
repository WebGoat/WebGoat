<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
In role-based access control scheme, a role represents 
a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be 
assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control 
normally consists of two parts: role permission management 
and role assignment. A broken role-based access 
control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses 
that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or 
somehow obtain unauthorized roles.
</p> 

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
Your goal is to explore the access control 
rules that govern this site. Each role has permission to 
certain resources (A-F). Each user is assigned one or more roles. 
Only the user with the [Admin] role should have access 
to the 'F' resources. In a successful attack, a user doesn't 
have the [Admin] role can access resource F.

<b>Solution:</b><br/>
To solve this exercise you have to know the name of the action, which
deletes employees. Of course you could just guess
it because it has a really logical name.
But we will look it up. So your first step is to log in as John with john as 
password. Use WebScarab to intercept the delete request.

As you can see the delete action is called DeleteProfile.
Now log in as Tom. Click in the list on his name and make sure WebScarab 
will intercept the next request. Click on a button, for example the 
'ViewProfile' button. Change in WebScarab the action to DeleteProfile 
and you are done!
