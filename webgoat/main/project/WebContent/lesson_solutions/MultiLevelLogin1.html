<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Multi Level Login 1</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
A Multi Level Login should provide a strong authentication. 
This is archived by adding a second layer. After having logged 
in with your user name and password you are asked for a 
'Transaction Authentication Number' (TAN). This is often used by 
online banking. You get a list with a lots of TANs generated only 
for you by the bank. Each TAN is used only once. Another method is 
to provide the TAN by SMS. This has the advantage that an attacker
 can not get TANs provided by the user.
</p> 

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
In this Lesson you try to get around the strong authentication. 
You have to break into another account. The user name, password 
and a already used TAN is provided. You have to make sure the server 
accept the TAN even it is already used. 
</p>

<b>Solution:</b><br/>
This Lesson has two stages. The first stage is only to show how a multi level login
works. In the second you have to break the strong authentication.
<p>
<b>Stage 1</b><br>
This stage should be rather straight forward. Give in as name Jane
and as password tarzan. </p>

Afthr clicking on the submit button
you will be asked for the TAN. <br><br>

<br>
Choose the correct TAN from the
list provided, click on the submit button and you are done.

<p>
<b>Stage 2</b><br>
The first step in this stage is equal to Stage 1. Log in as Jane with tarzan as password.
Now you will be asked for a TAN. Unfortunately you have only a already
used TAN from the victim. Fill in the TAN you have and make sure that WebScarab
will intercept the next request. Hit the submit button and change the hidden_tan
value to 1. </p>
