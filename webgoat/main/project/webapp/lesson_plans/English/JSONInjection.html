JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a simple and effective lightweight data exchange format. JSON can be in a lot of forms such as arrays, lists, hashtables and other data structures.
JSON is widely used in AJAX and Web2.0 application and is favored by programmers over XML because of its ease of use and speed.
However, JSON, like XML is prone to Injection attacks. A malicious attacker can inject the reply from the server and inject some arbitrary values in there.
