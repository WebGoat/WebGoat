<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
In role-based access control scheme, a role represents 
a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be 
assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control 
normally consists of two parts: role permission management 
and role assignment. A broken role-based access 
control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses 
that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or 
somehow obtain unauthorized roles.
</p> 

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
Your goal is to explore the access control 
rules that govern this site. Each role has permission to 
certain resources (A-F). Each user is assigned one or more roles. 
Only the user with the [Admin] role should have access 
to the 'F' resources. In a successful attack, a user doesn't 
have the [Admin] role can access resource F.
</p>

<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br/>
In stage 1 we tried to use an action we are not authorised to use.
In this stage we want to view a profile of an other person. We have the permission
for the action ViewProfile but we should not have the permission to see a profile
of another employee!

Log in as Tom with tom as password. Click on Tom's name in the list and make sure
webscarab will intercept the next request. Change the employee_id for example to 101.<br><br>
